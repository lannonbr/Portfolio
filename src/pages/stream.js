        <h1>Live Coding on Twitch</h1>
        <p>
          For years on Twitch, I was an active community member of many
          programming streams. Through all of it, I had the itch to try
          streaming myself and about halfway through 2019, I took the plunge.

        <p>
          In June 2019, I began livestreaming on Twitch.tv. I tinker around with
          many technologies like Gatsby, React, GitHub Actions, Docker, Node,
          etc. Tune in every Wednesday Evening at 4PM ET (UTC-4) at{' '}

          I am member of the Twitch{` `}
          <a href="https://livecoders.dev">Live Coders</a> team, an outgoing and
          enthusiastic group of devs that write code, teach about technology,
          and promote the technical community.

        <h2>Stream Projects</h2>
        <p>
          On my stream, you will see a lot of various projects spread out
          focusing around three main topics: Frontend Development, Data
          Vizualization, and Automation. From websites and frontend resources to
          data collection and vizualization, I try to balance my content between
          developing products and tooling.
