        <h1>Work</h1>
        <p>
          I am currently employed as a web developer and I am always learning
          new technologies and building new things. As a developer, I strive to
          create products and solutions that can empower other developers.

          If you want to see the hardware / software I use, head over to my{' '}
          <a href="/uses/">Uses Page</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          As well, I have a site which I list development resources that I
          personally use or recommend:{' '}
          <a href="https://lannonbr.dev">Lannonbr.dev</a>.
        </p>
        <h2>Community Involvement</h2>
        <p>
          I am an active member of the Syracuse Developer community and go to
          events such as Open Hack and the Syracue JS meetup. It's a place that
          I've found local dev opportunities and a place to help out / get
          answers in the tech community. You can find out more at{' '}
          <a href="https://syracuse.io">Syracuse.io</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          As well, I am heavily active on GitHub. If you want to learn more
          about my open source work, head over to my{' '}
          <a href="https://github.com/lannonbr">Github</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, I've found a haven inÂ the Twitch Dev community of individuals
          livestreaming and learning with others. I am a part of the{' '}
          <a href="https://livecoders.dev">LiveCoders</a> team and stream weekly
          working on various projects live. I partake in discussions with other
          streamers and community members in the stream chatrooms and getting
          involved with projects they're building and putting up on GitHub. You
          can learn more about my stream on the{' '}
